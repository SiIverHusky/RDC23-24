The image processing algorithm employs OpenCV, a library for computer vision, to acquire the video frame from the camera and manipulate it with various filters and operations. The algorithm aims to determine the order of red/blue and green boxes on one side of the frame. 

To achieve this, it first finds the largest green object in the image, as this would be one of the green boxes on the game field.

Next, it detects the objects of similar shape and size to the green object found, which have either red/blue or green colors. It applies a mask to the frame and extracts the contours of the colored regions. Then, it computes the minimum bounding rectangle of each contour and obtains the four vertices of the rectangle. It also calculates the center point of each rectangle and sorts them by their x-coordinates.

Finally, it classifies the color of each rectangle and encodes it in a boolean array, where 1 denotes red/blue and 0 denotes green. It also displays the array on the frame.
